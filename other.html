					A man who is conscious of the past and its traditions, recording engineer Dave Clementson holds a special place in the history of the San Jose Chamber Orchestra as he has been recording the orchestra since its inaugural performance in 1992. "I have recorded all of the orchestra's concerts, save for two," Clemenston shared in a phone interview. "My high school buddy Kurt Taylor was the first president of the SJCO, and he knew that I had the recording studio at the time. On a Saturday in January of 1992, he called me and asked if I wanted to record the inaugural concert. That recording was a two-track to DAT (digital audio tape)."<br><br>
					Mr. Clementson has from that weekend recorded every concert ("save for two") presented by the San Jose Chamber Orchestra. These recordings are referred to as archival or "reference recordings" -  "a reference recording of each performance," he says. "I record the concerts, then the recordings are excerpted and submitted with the grant applications. Barbara does a lot of world premieres, and often mine are their only recordings. Otherwise someone would have to specifically hire the orchestra to make recordings of those works."<br><br>
					While having been an integral part of the San Jose Chamber Orchestra for twenty years, Dave Clementson is primarily an electrical engineer. "I did I own a recording studio for a while, but by profession I am an electrical design engineer. I now work for Dolby Laboratories.” His knowledge of recording and audio technology is vast, as he has been involved in the industry for years. "I was employee nineteen at Digidesign, now Avid Technology. They are the company behind Pro Tools.” Laughing, he says "I had a hand in almost everything that had a power cord. I was also at CompuSonics. We made one of the first commercially viable digital audio workstations. This was in 1985, well before digital audio was available to the consumer. We were working on what you would recognize as the MP3 way back then-it was the beginning use of data compression on audio. The product was to be a digital recorder for the consumer market, but we had a professional editor that was used for TV and film soundtracks. One was used for audio sweetening on 'Saturday Night Live' back when it was funny. That’s how long ago it was."<br><br>
					Reference recording is much different from the recording of works for commercial purposes, and Clementson explored the differences with the incredible depth of knowledge gleaned in his twenty-five - plus years of working in the recording industry. "Making a reference recording is a lot different than making a CD. For example I can’t move the musicians-the most that I can do is move the microphone. And the theatre that we use is not pre-wired for recording. If you go to many of today's concert halls, like the Musikverein in Vienna, you see that the stage is prewired with mics above the orchestra. With the San Jose Chamber Orchestra, I go in with my setup and place myself between the audience and the orchestra."  (author's note: This difference is, of course, in no way to reflect poorly either on Mr. Clementson's work or that of the orchestra.)<br><br>
					"Recordings done in this way are really a 'risk analysis' on my part. I walk in as an audience member would and have no idea what the arrangement will be like. I make my best guess about what is to come, and hit ‘record.’  This type of recording is more like live broadcast: whatever the talent does “on air” is what goes on tape."<br><br>
					Being an integral member of the SJCO family has meant much more to Clementson than serving as the orchestra's recording engineer. Much like his amazing knowledge of the changes in the recording industry, he could also be considered the orchestra's historian: "At that time, the orchestra was playing the canon of chamber orchestra music as opposed to the more adventurous programming that Barbara is doing now. She and I have kept virtually everything from the concerts that I have recorded."<br><br>
					By happenstance, the opportunity to work with the San Jose Chamber Orchestra also changed Clementson's life: "The night before that first concert, I asked a woman to attend the concert with me-we have now been together for twenty years and married for thirteen."<br><br>

						To live a full life requires a combination of commitment to one’s true self and one’s mission and a true ability to remain both open and curious to possibility. Through having made the decision to leave an enviable life of working as a freelance musician in New York City fifteen years ago to embark on a journey that includes championing the works of living composers, Jennifer Kloetzel is one of the many who embody that philosophy. Ms. Kloetzel, cellist of the San-Francisco based Cypress String Quartet, is the featured soloist in The Art of the Cello, an evening of music being presented by the San José Chamber Orchestra that includes the premiere of Cloud Atlas, a work for cello and orchestra written by longtime collaborative partner Elena Ruehr.<br><br>
						“San Francisco is filled with an ‘entrepeneurial spirit’,” Jennifer says about her current city, “and when the Cypress Quartet started here we felt that we were surrounded by people who were very focused on creating something without a real knowledge of what the outcome would be. I relocated from New York to San Francisco to start this quartet. It was a huge leap of faith, of course, to move across the country with no job, but the idea of starting something seemed very interesting.”<br><br>
						Reflecting on the early days of the Cypress Quartet, Jennifer shares that they “worked very intensely during the first year, not only rehearsing but also talking about our mission and what we wanted the quartet to be. It was of course very challenging, as we made a commitment to ourselves that resulted in decisions like not taking outside work unless it involved the entire quartet, but that was the decision that we made.” The decision to focus on building a string quartet and the steadfast maintenance of that vision has paid off: in addition to playing ninety concerts a year, both nationally and internationally, the quartet has released twelve recordings (“Our thirteenth recording is being released in March 2012”) of repertoire ranging from works of Beethoven and Haydn to those of living composers, including the string quartets of Elena Ruehr and works by Pulitzer Prize-winner Jennifer Higdon and maintains an important presence in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br><br>
						The ensemble’s presence in San Francisco includes the presentation of its annual Call & Response concert at Herbst Theatre and collaborations with groups including the San José Chamber Orchestra. Their association with SJCO came in 2010, with the premiere of Pablo Furman’s “Paso del Fuego” for string quartet and chamber orchestra, “a massive work that was based on a cipher of each of our names,” Jennifer reminisces. “It was at that concert that Barbara Day Turner and I spoke about working together again. I really appreciate what Barbara does: it is vitally important for living composers to have musicians champion their work.”<br><br>
						Consequently, Elena Ruehr was already working on a piece for Ms. Kloetzel: “The first piece of Elena’s that CSQ heard was her Third Quartet, which was premiered by the Borromeo Quartet, and from that moment the quartet began commissioning her. She has since written two works for us. Cloud Atlas, a piece that was originally being written for me, transformed into this piece for cello, string orchestra and harp that is being premiered alongside Michael Touchi’s Tiento for 8 Cellos accompanied by other strings and known works including both J. S. Bach’s Suite No. 1 for Unaccompanied Cello and Heitor Villa-Lobos’ Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5 (written between 1938-45) for soprano and cello ensemble.<br><br>
						The responsibility involved in presenting a program of music that spans centuries is hardly a challenge for Ms. Kloetzel: quite the contrary, as the Cypress Quartet has been praised for their ability to present standard works from a new perspective while making new music sound known. “I thought that it would be wonderful to start with something known,” Ms. Kloetzel shares. “In contrast to the energetic opening movement of the Bach Suite, The Ruehr is a piece characterized by very long, soaring lines that starts with a cadenza exploring the entire range of the cello before the orchestra comes in.” Michael Touchi’s Tiento “has some of the same energy as the second movement of the Villa-Lobos, but of course I’m not sure as to ‘what the piece is going to be’ until we get into rehearsal. Being a chamber musician, of course we want to know what the piece is going to be but we do not have a real opportunity-even with studying scores-to get a real grasp of these works until we begin to put them together in a context that includes other musicians.”<br><br>
						Jennifer’s attitude to keeping alive is both holistic and philosophical: “I think of [Ignaz] Shuppanzigh, the violinist who premiered all of the Late Beethoven quartets,” she says. “Schubert later heard Shuppanzigh play Beethoven, and his writing later changed as a result of that exposure. There is that degree of collaboration that has driven things forward and continues to drive things forward.”<br><br>
						Ms. Kloetzel’s insightful and thoughtful approach to both musicmaking and life is exemplified through her veiw of our curent cultural landscape. “I think what worries us is that so much is distracting us-there was a time when people WOULD go to the symphony to hear what the new works were. However, we are reaching a point when there are students whose parents did not listen to this music.”<br><br>
						“Because I have done so much work in schools, I think that it is vitally important for young people to hear really fine performances. I have played for 120,000 kids and have never had a kid say it was boring. The reaction that young people are having to new music-the music of their time-is inspiring, and really gives me hope.”<br><br>
						Jennifer Kloetzel performed with the San José Chamber Orchestra on Sunday, January 8, 2012<br><br>

						February 2012<br><br>
						By Samuel Thompson<br><br>

						In January 2012 Barbara Day Turner received the honor of being named winner in the 2012 First Fest Arts and Culture division. An annual festival held on New Year’s Day, First Fest offers residents of both San José and the Silicon Valley an opportunity to recognize the history-making achievements that have taken place in their community through a process of nomination and voting.<br><br> 

						First Fest was started in 2009 by Leigh Weimers, author and semi-retired San José Mercury News journalist who one could say has “seen it all”: having grown up in the Napa Valley – “a great place to grow up in the 30s and 40s”, he reminisces – Mr. Weimers began his career as a journalist with the San José Mercury News in 1958 immediately after graduating from San José State University. “I had wanted to work for a major metropolitan newspaper – it wasn’t when I started, but the city kept growing and the Mercury News grew with it, so I did end up working for a major metropolitan newspaper. When I started, the population of San José was 120, 000 – now it’s close to one million. The development of Silicon Valley was a good thing, and being a journalist during that development was wonderful.”<br><br>
						Due to the amazing technological advances born in the Silicon Valley, “Everybody worldwide knows about the Silicon Valley, “ Weimers says, “but very few people associate both San José and the Santa Clara Valley with Silicon Valley.“ He continues to speak with awe and fascination at the numerous achievements that have taken place in the valley. “So many things have been conceived here, and (in creating First Fest) I wanted to give those things - from the first disc drive to the first Eggo Waffle - the attention that they deserved. The achievements and innovations in this valley – Apple became larger in value than Exxon Mobil and is now the most valuable company in the United States. San José has been a wonderful place to be over the last fifty years and I’ve been fortunate to interact with people who made that happen."<br><br>
						Now entering its fifth year, First Fest awards have been given in five categories including Personal, Arts and Culture, Business and Tech, Sports and Historical. Nominations are taken throughout the year, with voting taking place at the start of every calendar year. Weimers credits Connie Martinez of First Act Silicon Valley with the idea of making First Fest a virtual festival: “She thought that it would be more fun to do it online, where people did not have to come out anywhere on New Year’s day.”<br><br>
						Honorees are chosen through the online voting process and over the past four cycles have included the posthumous recognition given to Clyde P. Smith (who in 1966 became the first Black California Highway Patrol officer in San José and all of Santa Clara County), Bob Rempel (co-founder and first president of the first company to commercialize laser manufacturing) and, most recently, Barbara Day Turner and the San José Chamber Orchestra – the first San José ensemble to have received three ASCAP/League of American Orchestra Adventurous Programming Awards. Weimers shares a deep appreciation for Barbara’s great ability “to weave the ‘classics’ with music of up-and-coming composers that is both a great evening of entertainment and also uplifting.”<br><br>
						Being familiar with San José’s recent musical history, including the demise of the San José Symphony and the creation of Symphony Silicon Valley (which is now in its tenth season), Weimers credits Barbara Day Turner with directly contributing to the longevity of concert music and orchestral performance in the United States. “Bringing forth new music - I can’t think of a better way to breathe life into orchestras than the performance of new music and bringing it to new audiences. Known her for at least twenty years – came to fully appreciate it years later when I realized the body of work that she had created. “<br><br>

						On Barbara as a conductor and leader, Weimers gives her and the orchestra the highest praise: “She knows her stuff, people recognize it and then do the best for her. The SJCO is really tight, musically – they sound wonderful. “<br><br>
						In addition to having premiered over 110 commissioned works, mainly by regional composers, the SJCO is a vibrant and active component of cultural life in San José – much like Mr. Weimers. Upon his retirement from the San José Mercury News in 2005, Leigh was the recipient of many honors and proclamations. He remains an active member of his community and maintains a journalistic presence through his contributions to the online publication Silicon Valley Local magazine, and weekly posts to his blog, which is titled “Boomerometer” -- a barometer on aging for Baby Boomers. He is “pleased to be semi-retired and not HAVE to do something every day to keep bread on the table – you do have to do something, though.” <br><br> 
						Weimers has combined keeping himself active with remaining very relaxed, and his perspective on so many things, including riding the waves of life’s changes, is truly refreshing. Looking at his life and the region that he loves and champions, he shares with great pride that it is “one of the best places to live.  San Francisco Bay Area, Silicon Valley – it’s got it all.”<br><br>

						“All of us, whether or not we are warriors, have a cubic centimeter of chance that pops out in front of our eyes from time to time. The difference between an average man and a warrior is that the warrior is aware of this, and one of his tasks is to be alert, deliberately waiting, so that when his cubic centimenter pops out he has the necessary speed, the prowess, to pick it up”. – Carlos Castaneda<br><br>
						Possessing a repertoire spanning both operatic and concert work ranging from Haydn’s Creation to Jake Heggie’s recently premiered Piece of 9/11 – Memories from Houston and the role of Pip in Heggie’s critically-acclaimed Moby-Dick, soprano Talise Trevigne is a woman who definitely understands the significance of that cubic centimeter of chance.   No stranger to audiences in either the Silicon Valley or the San Francisco Bay area, Ms. Trevigne is a Bay Area native who has received tremendous accolades for her performances in major opera houses worldwide.   <br><br>
						Ms. Trevigne appears as the featured soloist featured in the San José Chamber Orchestra’s upcoming performance of Gustav Mahler’s Symphony No. 4 on March 4, 2012.<br><br>
						Speaking on the telephone via New York after recent performances with the San Diego Opera, Ms. Trevigne – a delightful, amiable soul - shared excitement about returning to her home state.   “Most of my work this season is in California, “ Ms. Trevigne said. “I’m a Bay Area girl – I grew up between between Mountain View and Los Altos, and my family moved to the East Bay when I went off to college– it’s always nice to come home.”<br><br>
						When speaking of how her collaborative partnership with Jake Heggie came to be, soprano Talise Trevigne shows a marvelous and inspiring degree of respect. “It’s really rare that you can call your colleague a dear friend, but Jake is truly like family, “ Ms. Trevigne says, referring to Heggie as “the most talented American composer of our time, yet the most sincere, generous, humble spirit that I have ever met.”<br><br>
						 Describing that the cubic centimeter of chance: “The collaboration with Jake started three years ago – I was interested in some songs of his and wanted to commission something from him. We emailed each other once. Six months later I happened to be in Dallas – I didn’t even know that Moby-Dick existed at that point, but was suddenly asked to fly to New York to audition for Patrick Summers of the Houston Grand Opera for an opera by Jake Heggie.” While Heggie himself was not at that audition, Summers and the other present were immediately confident that the role of Pip was made for Ms. Trevigne.<br><br>   
						“I later flew to California for performances with the Oakland East Bay Symphony and Jake was in the Bay Area, so he came out to the concert. Jake likes to write for specific voices in mind, and when we met after the performance, he got down on his knees – it’s so sweet – and said ‘The role of Pip just got so much bigger’.”<br><br>
						Commissioned by The Dallas Opera with San Francisco Opera, San Diego Opera, Calgary Opera and the State Opera of South Australia, Moby-Dick opened on April 30, 2010 at the Margot & Bill Winspear Opera House in Dallas. Ms. Trevigne and Heggie have continued to develop a very fruitful collaborative partnership, including the recently released CD “At the Statue of Venus” which includes songs by both Heggie and Glen Roven. “During my time at the Manhattan School of Music, I was the girl who wanted to sing chamber music. With my teacher Adele Addison (frequent collaborator with Leonard Bernstein) I grew up singing lieder so I was well-groomed in the ways of being a singer.”<br><br>
						Like her mentor Ms. Addison, Talise is equally at home with chamber music, concert and operatic performance and relishes the task of preparing characters in all forms. ‘In terms of actually preparing the music, there’s not really any difference in how one uses vocal technique,” she says. “The most distinct difference is that with modern opera there are other things to play off of, including the presence of additional characters, which let you find your way. The tricky part in concert or recital work is to bring one or more characters to life instantaneously for the audience without the help of props or anything  – you have to find different ways to communicate. I love playing with the timbres of the instrumentation around me as opposed to a character, but I approach every character the same. I start with the text, and then I build the character around the text – then have a story in mind before the character begins. “<br><br>
						Her working routine is also very clear and systematic. “I try to sit down at the same time every morning. I’ve learned that my peak hours - when I’m most focused and able to truly learn music - are from 9am to noon and 9-10:30 in the evening.”  A devoted mother, Ms. Trevigne uses the remaining time to handle life’s other details and to spend time with her family. <br><br>    
						Ms. Trevigne’s upcoming performance with the Chamber Orchestra is a “double debut”: not only is it her debut with the orchestra but it is also her first performance of Mahler’s Fourth Symphony (she has performed the soprano solo in Mahler’s Second Symphony) and she expressed great excitement both about the work and the opportunity to partner with Barbara Day Turner. “Perfection – Mahler and Strauss are my top favorite,” she said. “Barbara Day Turner and I go way back – we met I was still in conservatory. She has been so kind and so loving throughout my career and has always been supportive, so when she called and said ‘Can you come out and do a Mahler 4?’ I said yes! Really looking forward to it.”<br><br>
						With experiences that show a real acceptance of Castaneda’s philosophy and its variation -  “Life has a funny way of bringing people and situations together – all one has to do is watch and listen for his cues,” - one can imagine the smile present when Ms. Trevigne says “Barbara, Mahler, Mom – it’s gonna be a good homecoming.”<br><br>

						Soprano Talise Trevigne, a singer recognized for the "sheer beauty of her voice" and "exquisite stage presence," performed as the soloist in the San José Chamber Orchestra’s performance of Mahler Symphony No. 4 on Sunday, March 4, 2012.<br><br>

						March/April 2012<br><br>
						by Samuel Thompson<br><br>

						“Follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be.” – Joseph Campbell<br><br>
						When thinking of arts organizations and the concept of “service” undertaken by said organizations, one usually considers of educational concerts, in-school performances, and activities that take place beyond the concert hall. These are, of course, priceless endeavors – however, the concept of “service” can also be extended to the members of the organizations themselves. In his twenty-seven year tenure as Music Director of the Redwood Symphony, Eric Kujawsky has successfully worked both in service to the San Francisco Bay arts community and the many musicians who perform in the all-volunteer orchestra:   through the performance and recording of large and important works of the orchestral repertoire, the Redwood Symphony continues to live out its mission to “enrich the lives of its musicians and the community by presenting spirited, high-quality performances of ambitious orchestral music in an innovative, education al and entertaining format.”<br><br>
						The Redwood Symphony was founded in 1985. “I had just finished my DMA in conducting at Stanford University” Kujawsky shared in a phone interview,  “and decided to start an orchestra. In a region where there are many orchestras, I did want to impress people, so the focus became both on big projects and big pieces  - works that were once reserved for the major orchestras. ” The commitment given by the musicians – an all-volunteer group – is something both inspiring and enlightening. “Our members come from all over the Bay Area and includes people from all walks of life, including members of other orchestras. Their excitement and continued participation stems from the fact that the Redwood Symphony provides something both to the larger community and the musicians themselves that many other groups don’t, that being performances of cutting-edge repertoire.”<br><br>
						The list of works performed by the Redwood Symphony is incredibly impressive and includes all of the symphonies of Gustav Mahler, West Coast premieres of works by Leonard Bernstein, Danny Elfman and Elvis Costello, and six performances of complete operas in concert including both Porgy and Bess and Don Giovanni.<br><br>    
						Equally impressive and unparalleled among community orchestras is the Redwood Symphony’s highly praised body of recordings. Since it began recording in 1992, the orchestra has recorded six compact discs of challenging masterworks by Claude Debussy, Aaron Copland, Igor Stravinsky and Béla Bartók. The opportunity to record came with “a new audiophile recording company that had started, Clarity Recordings,” Kujawsky says. “We made two recordings with Clarity Records, the first being a coupling of Igor Stravinsky’s The Soldier’s Tale and Petrushka. After that partnership dissolved we started our own label – Redwood Recordings – and were later able to buy the rights to the Clarity recordings.”  <br><br>  
						One significant highlight of the orchestra’s six disc discography includes its 2000 recording which features both endings of Bartók’s virtuostic Concerto For Orchestra alongside Enescu’s First Rumanian Rhapsody.     Kujawsky takes a very philosophical look at the recording industry, from the past to the future: “Now that we’re thinking of our seventh CD – we don’t have to produce an actual CD as everything can be put in the cloud. I still miss the LP,” he shares. “The program notes were very educational.”<br><br>
						The growth and development of the Redwood Symphony has taken place almost in tandem with that of the San José Chamber Orchestra, which was founded in 1991. Kujawsky expresses excitement about guest conducting the orchestra in what he calls a “high-energy” program. “I love the music of Michael Daugherty.   He has such an ability to combine classical idioms with popular styles like jazz and funk.“ Being a clarinetist – “I now play just for fun” – he relishes the chance to conduct Aaron Copland’s Clarinet Concerto, which will be his second collaboration with Michael Corner. Also featured is a string orchestra arrangement of Beethoven’s String Quartet in C Major, Op. 59, No. 3. “This arrangement – ‘retouching of the quartet’ – is conceptually akin to Mahler’s work on the Beethoven symphonies. It is still evolving, and the changing elements are fascinating to me. In the outer movements, a solo quartet will be featured as a reminder of the origins of the piece, and the addition of the string bass also brings more options.” Thinking of Mahler again, Kujawsky muses that the compositional process is one that first exists in the imagination but is also open to the changes possible through bringing those compositions to life in performance.<br><br>

						So is there any challenge to conducting a chamber orchestra when one is drawn to larger works? “I have been leaning towards late works for quite some time, including those of Bartok, Mahler, Sibelius, Stravinsky, Mozart, Brahms and Beethoven,” Kujawsky says. “Every conductor is a storyteller – and the telling of that story might involve changes, from dynamics to orchestration or the number of players.    For me, this is all a labor of love – blazing new trails in what the possibilities are for community orchestras”.<br><br>

						Eric Kujawsky conducted the San Jose Chamber Orchestra in a performance featuring works of Beethoven, Copland, and Michael Daugherty on Sunday, March 25, 2012. For more information on the Redwood Symphony, please visit www.redwoodsymphony.org.<br><br>

						“...when a soul succeeds in accomplishing its goal, in fulfilling what it has agreed to do, there is a richness and specialness to the lifetime of that personality that is recognized and honored by its fellow souls, both physical and nonphysical.”<br><br>
						       ...Gary Zukav, The Seat of the Soul<br><br>
						On April 12, 2012, violinist Kenneth Renshaw was awarded first prize in the Senior Division of the Menuhin Competition which took place in Beijing, China. Many of the previous winners, including Tasmin Little, Isabelle van Keulen, Nikolaj Znaider, Ilya Gringolts, Julia Fischer and Ray Chen have all gone on to establish major international careers.<br><br>
						Kenneth Renshaw is one of the featured soloists with the San Jose Chamber Orchestra during its annual Young Artists Concert, which takes place on Sunday, May 20, 2012. Already a veteran of the concert stage, the eighteen year old Renshaw has a very impressive list of credentials: in 2008 he was named a Jack Kent Cooke Young Artist by National Public Radio’s ”From The Top” on which he was featured, and also won the California Youth Symphony Young Artist Concerto Competition the same year. In 2009, Kenneth was awarded First Prize in the 2009 Los Angeles Philharmonic Bronislaw Kaper Competition. He has appeared as soloist with orchestras including the China Philharmonic, The Staatskapelle Weimar, and the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra.<br><br>
						During our conversation-a short one due to a travel snafu that resulted in much rescheduling-Kenneth showed a remarkable amount of poise and spoke with a level of humility, self-awareness and clarity that is hallmark of many great artists. Regarding his recent competition success, he shared that “it is a little bit intimidating, as there are so many amazing artists who have come through this competition. I choose to do competitions because they are very useful in that they help me to work hard towards a goal, and to think about music on a much deeper and detailed level than I would if I were not participating.”<br><br>
						This level-headedness and focus on music making at the highest level has lead to a keen level of maturity.  “I wasn’t expecting anything at all-you never know what to expect in competitions,” he said. “No matter how well prepared you are, you never know what the outcome is going to be. I didn’t care so much about what the results would be as much as I was grateful to participate and meet so many incredible young violinists, meet the jury, and attend the master classes.”<br><br>
						When asked how and if capturing such a large and important honor has changed his life, Renshaw grew reflective: “Before the competition, for the last two years, I definitely knew that I wanted to play music for the rest of my life. I truly enjoy solo, chamber music and orchestral playing, so this competition didn’t really change my mind about that. Winning has made me more motivated to go even further and delve even deeper into the music as there will probably be many opportunities that come with it.” Those opportunities include performances with the Peking Sinfonietta the following season.<br><br>
						A native of San Francisco, Kenneth began playing the violin at the age of four (“or five-quite a long time ago”, he said) and has been involved in the musical life of his home region for quite some time. Having had many teachers through his developmental years, he spoke very highly of Li Lin, his teacher and mentor of the last seven years. “Li Lin is unbelievable because he has this uncanny knack of knowing exactly what to bring out of each student. All of his students sound so different from each other, which I respect because on both musical and technical levels he is able to bring out their unique voices as much as is humanly possible at the time."<br><br>
						For his performance with the San Jose Chamber Orchestra, Renshaw will play J. S. Bach’s Concerto in E Major, and “is really looking forward to it. I have known of Barbara Day Turner through a mutual friend, though I have not ‘officially’ met her. It is always exciting to work with a musician who shows his/her personality through their musicmaking.”<br><br>
						The reverence with which Renshaw spoke of his mentor Lin is similar to that he expressed about Itzhak Perlman, with whom Renshaw has studied for last few years during the annual Perlman Music Program. “I have been going to the Perlman program for the past few years, and it’s one of those places where once you go you keep going back...Mr. Perlman has a very warm, empathetic and comfortable personality. He does not like to get too overbearing or serious with his students, although he does demand a very high level of music making. He’s not an intimidating personality-once you get past that first encounter with him-which can be intimidating because of his reputation-then itís really wonderful to work with him.”<br><br>
						With a calendar of concerts and opportunities to collaborate with some of the most important artists of our time, Kenneth is very focused on his future as a musician. After completing his senior year of high school (“less than a week”) and the summer with Mr. Perlman, Kenneth will attend the New England Conservatory where he will study with Donald Weilerstein. At NEC he will be joined by Brian Hong, a violinist and Virginia native who is also a “From The Top” alumnus.<br><br>
						Like his teachers, Renshaw does not display an overbearing level of seriousness when speaking of his craft: again, one is immediately drawn to his clarity and true humility. One can, however, sense the wonder he feels while viewing the horizon: !There is a new generation of classical musicians emerging and it’s a very exciting time.”<br><br>
