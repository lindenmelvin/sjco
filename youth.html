					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission of the San José Youth Chamber Orchestras is to equip young string students with the abilities needed for excellent performance, as well as to inspire a love for music and the development of life skills such as teamwork and discipline. The four youth chamber orchestras are the recipients of coaching and mentoring by the professional artists of the Chamber Orchestra, as well as guidance by their wonderful conductors. <br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekly rehearsals culminate in several concerts per year, as well as invitations to special events, such as performances for Mentor Graphics and Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph’s Season of Hope. Masterclasses, field trips and the occasional senior orchestra tour round out the year's activities. <br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each season is concluded by a Side-by-Side Concert, with students of the Youth Orchestra performing alongside members of the San José Chamber Orchestra.
